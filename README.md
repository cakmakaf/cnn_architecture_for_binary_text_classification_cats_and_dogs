# CNN_Architecture_for_Binary_Text_Classification_Cats_and_Dogs
CNN architecture for binary text classification process of cats and dogs text files.
First we load the text data from seperate cat and dog files and pre-process it with the helper functions.
Then we train the data using CNN architecture for text data. 
Finally we test the test documents from another loaded file providing the accuracy metrics as how much likelyhood do they carry based on the trained cat or dog documnets.
